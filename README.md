# ask-nasa

In this project, I am working with an open API and requesting data from the NASA API. A new image is uploaded to the APOD server every day. When you open the page, an image and its title and explanation is displayed. I created an input where you can see images from previous days. When you pick an older date, the data changes on the page.
